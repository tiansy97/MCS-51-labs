# MCS-51 Labs
 Lab experiment code in undergraduate classes (using 8051-compatible MCUs, such as AT89S51 and STC89C52)
 
 Development tools: Keil C51
 
 Major concepts: 1. GPIO; 2. timer and interrupt; 3. digital signal, digital filtering; 4. A/D, D/A; 5. PWM, PID control for motors; 6. sensors (temperature, distance, speed, etc.); 7. LED segment displays; 8. Serial communications with PC; and so on.
