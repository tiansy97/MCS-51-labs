The system measures the room temperature using a temperature sensor. The analog
            output is converted to diginal signals by the ADC0809 chip. The code reads the 
            signal and converts it to real temperatures, and it applies a digital filter to 
            stablize the readings. It then displays the temperature on LEDs.
